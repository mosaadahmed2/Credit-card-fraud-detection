# Credit-card-fraud-detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms

As credit card is the most prominent method of payment for online and day to day purchases nowadays, the cases of fraud associated with it
are also growing.As such, credit cards are the most targeted as they are linked to both personal information and accounts.To effectively detect
these fraud transactions, we use a data consisting of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions to create a model that classifies these
transactions with a high accuracy based on a machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
